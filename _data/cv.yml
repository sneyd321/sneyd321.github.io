      institution: Room Renting, Oakville, Ontario
      year: Aug 2022 - Present
      description:
        - Developed continuous integration scripts using GitHub Actions to automate database schema migrations, execution of tests with Docker Compose, deployments to Google Cloud Run and provisioning of COS VM’s for MySQL and Redis.
        - Developed two progressive web apps using Flutter that supports document building, file sharing, real time messaging and push notifications. Both apps use GraphQLProvider to manage state.
        - Designed a GraphQL API gateway in Python using strawberry and Fast API that generates authorization JWT’s, resolves queries/mutations asynchronously and manages service discovery. 
        - Modeled one-to-one, one-to-many and many-to-many entity relationships using asynchronous SQLAlchemy with automated connection pool recycling, database caching and configured automated database upgrades with Alembic.
        - Designed and developed a serverless cloud scheduler that utilizes the Kubernetes client library to execute long running tasks as Kubernetes Jobs in a cluster. This resulted in an architectural component that could execute any container asynchronously which significantly reduced complexity in code and increased testability.
        - Designed and developed eight Python/Fast API microservices deployed on Google Cloud Run that connect to a Redis and MySQL VM’s through a serverless VPC connector.
        - Created test plans and implemented test automation using tools like pytest, postman, flutter test package, junit, Flask test client, FastAPI test client and Kubernetes client library.
