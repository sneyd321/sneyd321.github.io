Room Renting Landlord is a Progressive Web App for first time landlords. The goal of the platform is to centralize landlord - tenant communication to a single application instead of the current practice of switching back and forth between email, text and some other communcation platform. 

The app was originally written in Android as a Proof of Concept and has migrated to Flutter. This app is deployed as a Progressive Web Application but can become an iOS, Android, MacOS, Windows or Linux application.

### Creating and Sharing Documents
Users enter their data to fill in the requierd fields for the document they are creating. Once completed the app will automatically fill in common presets and generate the document in the backend. Once completed the backend will send a notification the the user notifying a new revision has been created. To change the data they can update the individual pages and create a new revision. Landlords and Tenants can both sign documents through the app as well.

### Recieving Maintenance Tickets
Tenants use the tenant version of the app to take pictures of maintenance issues, attach a breif description and report the issue to their landlord. The landlord can then view the report and talk back and forth on the issue. The landlord can use this comment section to keep communcation organized to a specific issue, schedule time to fix the issue with the tenant and add references to the lease agreement if the ticket is invalid. 

### Sending and Recieving Notifications
The landlord can receive notifications for new document revisions, when tenants create an account, when tenants sign the lease and new maintenance tickets. Landlords can also create a notification to send to tenants providing a one way communication channel to imform tenants.
