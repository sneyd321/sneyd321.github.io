### About
Full Stack Developer for [roomrenting.ca](https://roomrenting.ca). 

I started at Tata Consultancy Services in July 2020 and was placed on contract as a QE Analyst at the Royal Bank of Canada. 

To improve my workflows I developed scripts to optimize and standardize testing that are in use internationally throughout RBC. My scripts are used to automate:
1. Multi-factor authentication during sign in that is in use by 70% backend related test cases.
2. improved test automation configuration time by 2.5 hours per job to 10 mins per job and maintenance effort from 10 minutes per job to 30 seconds per job.
3. Automated report generation that can keep Project Managers, Developers, QE Managers and other QE Analysts in the loop on currently stability of the backend.
4. Created tooling to bind Jira Tickets to failed test cases to provide better synchronization between Project Managers, Developers, QE Managers and other QE Analysts. 

I was promoted to a QE Lead after 1 year and was responsible for managing the release of the API gateway component connecting RBC banking services to their Mobile and Web backend, reporting to director level management and coordinating team members to complete tickets before deadlines.


I left Tata Consultancy Services in July 2022 to focus on [roomrenting.ca](https://roomrenting.ca).
