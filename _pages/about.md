2. Improved test automation configuration time by 2.5 hours per job to 10 mins per job and maintenance effort from 10 minutes per job to 30 seconds per job.
3. Automated report generation that can keep Project Managers, Developers, QE Managers and other QE Analysts in the loop on currently stability of the backend.
4. Created tooling to bind Jira Tickets to failed test cases to provide better synchronization between Project Managers, Developers, QE Managers and other QE Analysts. 

At RBC:
1. Promoted after 1 year to a QE Lead, a role that requires 8-10 years exerience.
